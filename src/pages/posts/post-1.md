Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro here! Here, I will share my 
learning journey as I build a new site.

## What I have accomplished 

1. **Installing Astro**: First I create a new Astro project and deployed it.

2. **Making Page**: I then learned to make pages by creating new `.astro` files
and placing them in the `src/pages` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post. I now have Astro pages and 
Markdown posts!

## Whats next

I will finish the astro tutorial, and keep adding more posts. Watch this space
for more to come.
